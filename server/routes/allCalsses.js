This session needs patience and surrender to let the healing flow.</p>\\n<p>Dynamic Yoga<br>Strong, dynamic workshop style class with arm balances, inversions, backbends &amp; twists. Be prepared to keep a brisk pace and explore poses we don&rsquo;t normally get to experience in a general class. Dynamic sequencing combines breath and movement to build strength, flexibility, endurance, concentration and compassionate approach to flow with the breath through sun salutations, standing, sitting, supine, prone and inverted postures. Centre progressively allows newer and more advanced participants the opportunity to go deeper to relax, honouring the body as needed. This is a great session to work on extra fats and weight management. Everyone is welcome.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Children Yoga</p>\\n<p>Introducing children to yoga helps them learn healthy lifestyle habits and set the foundation for a responsible and happy future. We use chanting, balancing, memory games, moral role plays and gazing practices to improve their memory, concentration and focus. We motivate them to express their aptitude, skills and raise their self-worth as well as boost their confidence. Through dramatization and role play kids express their emotions better. Relaxed learning deepens the perception, reducing distractions and increasing attention span. This activates the dormant areas of the brain. Children are born yogis, lets preserve their yoginnocence.</p>\\n<p>Sukshma Yoga</p>\\n<p>A practice that uses slow movement, props and longer holds to stimulate and release body toxins. The nature of this practice is meditative, asking us to slow down, turn in and shift from doing to being.&nbsp;This session is the session meant for longevity, purification and release of all the unwanted stress. This opens up the blocked pathways inside our body and joints. It&rsquo;s a releasing factor to our suppressed subtle energies. This practice is applicable to everyone from childhood, adulthood, motherhood, fatherhood, parenthood, homemakers/ housewives, grand parenthood. This clears out the extras so that we naturally be the best of ourselves.</p>\\n<p>Pratyahara</p>\\n<p>A bridge that has a strong connectivity of two destinations is pratyahara, these innovative sessions are made to make one reach the potential destination through the applied knowledge of our scriptures. Internal journeys through each of the &lsquo;dwara&rsquo; and de-knotting the knots or &lsquo;granthis&rsquo; inside is the key essence of this session. This session induces towards dharana, dhyana and samadhi if perceived with utmost sincerity and reverence.</p>\"}]",

This has helped me really understand what pregnancy means to a woman and  how yoga can help her embrace the physiological, psychological and emotional changes in her.  I am grateful for the prenatal journey I could embark on during my pregnancy and I think no woman should miss out on experiencing this.  This is what motivates me to teach Prenatal Yoga.",
